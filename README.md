<summary>Checking time spent by each user</summary>

<summary>Setting up time limits, blocked apps and websites per user</summary> 

**Time limits**

Setting a time limit causes automatic logoff of the selected user after due time. There are text-to-speech reminders which fire up 20, 10, 5, 2 and 1 minutes before logoff will occur.

**Blocked websites**

Setting a website as blocked adds it to the hosts file and sets it to the loop-back address making it mostly inaccessible.

**Blocked apps**

Blocking an app beside using the desktop app can also be done through the web app. Doing it that way requires the user to input a direct path to the application. Blocking an app is implemented by periodically checking the processes list and killing it when it's running.

**Text messages**

The user can send text messages that will be displayed using a message box on the screen of the selected computer.
